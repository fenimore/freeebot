Twitter bot for [freestuffs](http://freestuffs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [@Freeebot](https://twitter.com/FreeeBot)

### Getting started:
- The proper twitter api keys should be loaded into the secrets.py module

### Second thoughts and todos:
- New York is too big... too many posts - try something like one of the buroughs...
- Twitter character length check

### Why three Es?
Because freebot was taken
